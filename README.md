# Forecasting Carbon Emissions for FTSE 100 Companies

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the carbon emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) for companies listed in the FTSE 100 index. The project applies various machine learning models, including ARIMA, LSTM, CNN, and ANN, to historical financial and environmental data. The goal is to create reliable models that forecast emissions, aiding in decision-making for sustainability and investments.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Scripts for importing, cleaning, and preparing FTSE 100 company data.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of several models (ARIMA, LSTM, CNN, ANN) to predict carbon emissions.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing model performances using metrics such as RMSE.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Genetic Algorithms and GreyKite models for improving predictions.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow), C#
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: ARIMA, LSTM, CNN, ANN, GreyKite, Genetic Algorithms
- **Data Sources**: Proprietary data from Refinitiv (not included in the repository).

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the main code, organized into subfolders (models, data_processing, evaluation, advanced_techniques).
- **saved_models/**: Holds saved model outputs.
- **data/**: Placeholder folder with explanation of the data source.
